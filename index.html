        We have all been new comers at some point in our lives. First day of school. First day at work. And many more different first days. 
        <br> <br> In those moments, <strong>how were you welcomed? How did you welcome others? </strong>
        During a short running time of one minute, <span style = "background-color: #d1b15a"> Marhaba</span> captures the excitement of the new comers and how they are welcomed.
