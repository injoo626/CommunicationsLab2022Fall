# Marhaba 
## 30 Minutes Film Festival Website 

### Project Description
  Project Marhaba is an website that introduces a short film of the same title and the 30 Minutes Film Festival. The film *Marhaba* revolves around the concept of **welcoming** the new comers. We have all been newcomers at some point in our lives: new to school, work, family, and many more. First days are always a odd mixture of anxiety and excitement. How do you remember those moments? How were you welcomed? How did you welcome others? *Marhaba* captures the emotions of the first week of university. 

  The website delivers the information about the film that could enhance the audience's understanding. The DIRECTOR page, for example, includes a short biography of the director and her filmography so that the audience can get a quick overview of the artist's style and perspective. The 30 Minutes Film Festival page explains the context behind producing this specific piece in 30 minutes. By reading the website, even someone who has never heard of the 30 Minutes Film Festival can easily understand the purpose and the goal of the festival. The website further encourages fellow artists by sharing details of the film that might be helpful for future productions. For example, artists on a location hunt can get information about filmable spaces in the Campus Center from the LOCATION page. 

### Development Process
   The website is built based on only **two** toned-down colors extracted from the film poster to increase the communicatability. For a coherent appearnace, all texts are in the same font but different sizes and styles. Four menu buttons on top of each page were not included in the initial design of the website but later added for users' convenience. The buttons change color to indicate the current page which helps users easily navigate between different pages on the website. 
   
   Pages with multiple sub-pages have dropdown menus so that users can go to the wanted page on a click. Dropdown menu appears when users hover over the menu button. I first made the menu to appear only when hover but later included a clickable feature. I had inconvenient experience with dropdown menus when the menu disappeared as I try to click the sub-content. I solved the problem by making the dropdown menu stay when a user clicks on it. When the user clicks it again the menu disappears. 
   
   The main page is designed to allow users access all the pages in a click. All pages except festival explanation page and watching film page are accessible with vertical menu buttons. I had to find a way to specifically include those two pages in the home page. I linked those two pages each in festival logo and the film poster as I did not want to create another button in the main page that was already full. I then noticed that users need to know where each link delivers them before clicking to reduce unnecessary wandering. To do so, I included hidden messages that tell users what each link does. The messages appear only when users hover over the film poster and the festival logo. 
   
### Reflection
  It was an overall an exciting experience to create a website of my own. I learned a lot about designing a user-friendly space that guides users to the wanted page easily and clearly. Expectations that I take for granted as a web-designer might not be as obvious to the users. For example, not everyone would expect clicking on the film poster will link them to watching the film. To prevent this, I constantly put myself in a complete stranger's point of view to eliminate any potential confusion that users might experience. 
  
  Most of the initial expectations were met in the final version. While working on the website, I referred to the initial wireframe design. One of the features that I could not include was a page that introduces other students' work. I wanted to include a page that introduces films produced by other students to help users better understand the concept of 30 Minutes Film Festival. I thought understanding the purpose of 30 Minutes Film Festival is a crucial to understand how and why the film was produced in a certain way. I could not make this page due to lack of time and resource but I hope to include this page in the near future after receiving links to each student's website.
