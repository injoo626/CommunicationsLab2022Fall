# Marhaba 
## 30 Minutes Film Festival Website 

### Project Description
  Project Marhaba is an website that introduces a short film of the same title and the 30 Minutes Film Festival. The film *Marhaba* revolves around the concept of **welcoming** the new comers. We have all been newcomers at some point in our lives: new to school, work, family, and many more. First days are always a odd mixture of anxiety and excitement. How do you remember those moments? How were you welcomed? How did you welcome others? *Marhaba* captures the emotions of the first week of university. 

  The website delivers the information about the film that could enhance the audience's understanding. The DIRECTOR page, for example, includes a short biography of the director and her filmography so that the audience can get a quick overview of the artist's style and perspective. The 30 Minutes Film Festival page explains the context behind producing this specific piece in 30 minutes. By reading the website, even someone who has never heard of the 30 Minutes Film Festival can easily understand the purpose and the goal of the festival. The website further encourages fellow artists by sharing details of the film that might be helpful for future productions. For example, artists on a location hunt can get information about filmable spaces in the Campus Center from the LOCATION page.
  
  The website is built based on only **two** toned-down colors extracted from the film poster to increase the communicatability. For a coherent appearnace, all texts are in the same font but different sizes and styles.
